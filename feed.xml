&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five prompts have been given to pick from&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movie that you pick has to satisfy at least one of the prompts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The prompts are not mutually exclusive. If you find a movie that fits more than one prompts, even better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No documentaries or web series&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No movie reviews - your articles have to be inspired by an aspect of the movie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movie can be of any genre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep in mind your audience while writing the article (18 and above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a #moviechallenge on Instagram and announce the challenge on kMITRA’s IG handle. Invite reader suggestions. Announce movies chosen by writers (as and when they choose them). Keep engaging followers till the edition goes live. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-of-book-edition-&quot;&gt;Review of Book Edition :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motive was to make your article readable and interesting for all those who have read your book and also all those who haven’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Blog:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Different name for blog(url) since site may crash if included under the same name&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Who will be the editor for the edition?
The team decided that Meghana and Abhay will be the editors for the next edition i.e the January edition of 2020,the 44th issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhoomi and Radhika would look after the document of the fund raiser event which kMITRA organised.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nainika and Sadwi are expected to write report of the FR event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The team decided that there would be 4 days alloted for recruitments with seniors i.e third years looking after the orientation and juniors i.e second years looking after the invigilation of the exam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The club heads would look after the t-shirts of the juniors i.e Second years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s the designer’s duty to approach and follow up with the writer for a creative feature image and it’s hence eventually becomes the designers’ job to look after the part where every article gets a creative and an attractive feature image.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The theme for this edition is “10 years of &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;__.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tentative date for the next edition is 6th January,2020. Buffer of two days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We can have webpages for current issues written by people of kMITRA with awareness posts on Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;

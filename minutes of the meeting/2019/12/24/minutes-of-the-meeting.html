The team decided that Meghana and Abhay will be the editors for the next edition i.e the January edition of 2020,the 44th issue. Bhoomi and Radhika would look after the document of the fund raiser event which kMITRA organised. Nainika and Sadwi are expected to write report of the FR event. The team decided that there would be 4 days alloted for recruitments with seniors i.e third years looking after the orientation and juniors i.e second years looking after the invigilation of the exam. The club heads would look after the t-shirts of the juniors i.e Second years. It’s the designer’s duty to approach and follow up with the writer for a creative feature image and it’s hence eventually becomes the designers’ job to look after the part where every article gets a creative and an attractive feature image. The theme for this edition is “10 years of ____.” Tentative date for the next edition is 6th January,2020. Buffer of two days. We can have webpages for current issues written by people of kMITRA with awareness posts on Instagram." />

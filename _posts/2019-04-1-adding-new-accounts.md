   password to something more secure.
2. Go to Dashboard->Users->Add New
3. Create new user accounts for all the people whose details you have received
4. Set role to Trainee Writer and uncheck the “Send the new user an email about
   their account” button

If you should have any questions please leave a message in the kMITRA Devs

What I learnt:
	1: Git 
	2: GitHub 
	3: Jekyll 
1: Git: 
	In Git, I learnt how to initialise a repository, clone a repository, creating and merging branches, pushing and pulling changes etc.

2: GitHub: 
	In GitHub, I learnt how to fork a repository, opening Pull requests, how commits works, the need of Version control System and Remote repository.

3: Jekyll: 
	This was a fresh concept for me and this is the first time I came to know about Jekyll and how it works.
	I learnt creating a static webpage Posts, adding it to repository and rebuilding the site.
